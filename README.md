# AndroidChatApp CampusBuddy

CampusBuddyis a chat application for intra college level.It is feature driven android application with lots of features which you cant find in other chat apps lik whats app.The list of features are as below:

1.  In this app the admin can create groups for each class such as Third Year Information Technology. And all the users who are studying in Third Year Information Technology will automatically get added in to this groups. And faculty from whole Information Technology will get added.Only the faculty can send messages to the groups.

2.  The faculty have a variety of data file options to upload to the groups such as images,pdfs,docs,ppts,txts,etc. The student can download this files or can open it directly without downloading if supporting apps are availabe.

3.  As our colleges have a lots of clubs for student welfare the club members have to manually go to all clases and give information about the club service. So we decided to add the clubs activity where every club will get a seperate platform to advertise there club service information. We have provided a poster option to upload a image for the advertisement for the club, they can also provide there contact info, venue and timing of the service.

4.  Similar to the clubs we have a seperate activity for college events such as gathering,sports,etc. All the above club options are also provided with the events activity.

So at the last you can make changes according to your college needs.
Thank you.
